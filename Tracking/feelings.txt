    NFT isn't looking as good as I thought.
    Development has been messy today and yesterday.
    Maybe I should make some things darker?
    RANDOMIZED DARKNESS!
    Light and dark difference
    Less weird black spaces
    Triangle drag
    Improved (Randomized) Monochrome
    Light outline boxes in the background

    Different widths and aspects of traits should
    be randomized and based off probability

    (For example the width on the glitch branches
    should be randomized and based off probability)

    Drag incremental distance should be changed

    Everything should mash up together and give the
    vibe that you describe. Randomization, probability,
    and different traits and things should be
    incoporated.

    Colors should matchup and always look good with
    eachother. (Improved color system, color matching
    system.)
