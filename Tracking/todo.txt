NFT
* Look over these ideas and see which ones are best
- More artistic, but still mad

- Commom shapes (triangle, layered squares,
    different shapes in different functions
    example: shard with trangles, or maybe censor)

- Triangles or other shapes edging off the walls

- Less of just shapes, more mosaic combined shapes

- Connector shapes (rectangles than connect
    different shapes)

- More/Better glitch effects

- Stairs

- Repeating/Drag other shapes

- Fix code to make less randomzied and more
    probablity based. Optimize too or
    refactor or whatever.

Presentation
- Fix Script (ETH/Ether part, general)

- To Do (Main):
    Log probabilities and traits, and how they work.
    2D => 3D
    Seperate censor bars
    Triangles
    Layered squares (Stretched?)
    Shapes briding off the walls
    Other things to improve it
    Make all NFTs look nice

    Incoporate more traits
    Incorporate more of a probability basis
    Rarity calculation (Ether Cost Calculation)
    Do something/add something with reroll specialty
    Super pixely theme (High outline/width or whatever for it)

- Polygon it is!
    10k NFTs (need enough traits and things to create 1k unique NFTs)
    NFT Trait Tracker (writes to a file, scans it, prevents NFTs from being identical or similar)

    Math:
        If you have 10k NFTs ranging from $3-$5, you could make a lot of money.
        Quanity > Cost
        In theory, you could make a few bucks hundred bucks, or a couple thousand, which either way is good.
        If sales go good, increase the price.

    Again, in order to create 10k NFTs, you need to create enough traits, colors, names, and other things for each of them to be unique.

    Cost calculation system is required. 
    Metadata system or whatever is required too, I suggest you learn about it.
    You may also wanna learn about NFTs, Ethereum, Ether, and Blockchains too.

    The mix of social media attention and website attention will surely make it succeeed.

    An NFT feedback forum would be cool too.

- Website
    You may want to start learning the perqusites for create your NFTs website.

    Heres what you need to learn:
        HTML (Book)
        CSS (Book)
        JavaScript (30 Days of JavaScript, Book)
        Some JavaScript framework (Vue.js or whatever)
    
    You can host it on a GitHub Page, or cough up the money to host it cheaply.
