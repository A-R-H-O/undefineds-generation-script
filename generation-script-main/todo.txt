NFT
* Look over these ideas and see which ones are best
- Card Format with description, or poloroid photo
- More artistic, but still mad

- Color Schemes (all have a common/similar color,
    examples: red (all similar red colors), or
    multiple of a common color that look good
    example: (dark blue and a shade of yellow)) ★
- Different main types (E.g. monochrome, colorful)
- Commom shapes (triangle, layered squares,
    different shapes in different functions
    example: shard with trangles, or maybe censor)
- Triangles or other shapes edging off the walls
- Less of just shapes, more mosaic combined shapes
- Connector shapes (rectangles than connect
    different shapes)
- More/Better glitch effects
- Stairs
- Repeating/Drag other shapes

- Fix code to make less randomzied and more
    probablity based. Optimize too or
    refactor or whatever.

Issues
- Cost ($150-$800 in theory, probably around,
    slightly more slightly less).
    - Free with Polygon, but prevents from
        doing auctions.
